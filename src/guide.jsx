        <h1>Oven to Air Fryer Conversion Guide</h1>

        <p>
          Converting oven cooking instructions to an air fryer is simple once you
          understand the basic rule: air fryers cook faster because of rapid hot
          air circulation.
        </p>

        <h2>The basic conversion rule</h2>
        <p>
          Reduce the oven temperature by about 20°C and shorten the cooking time
          by around 20%. Always check food a few minutes early since air fryers
          vary by model.
        </p>

        <h2>Why air fryers cook faster</h2>
        <p>
          Air fryers use powerful fans to circulate hot air, which cooks food
          more efficiently than a conventional oven. This creates crispier
          textures in less time.
