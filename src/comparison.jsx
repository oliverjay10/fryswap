        <h1>Oven vs Air Fryer: What’s the Difference?</h1>

        <p>
          Both ovens and air fryers cook food using heat, but they work in
          slightly different ways. Understanding these differences can help you
          choose the best method for your cooking.
        </p>

        <h2>How air fryers work</h2>
        <p>
          Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly around food using a powerful fan.
          This creates a crisp texture similar to frying but with much less oil.
        </p>

        <h2>How ovens work</h2>
        <p>
          Conventional ovens heat the air inside a large cavity, which cooks
          food more slowly and evenly. They’re better for large dishes or baking.
        </p>

        <h2>Which cooks faster?</h2>
        <p>
          Air fryers typically cook food about 20% faster than ovens because of
          their smaller size and stronger air circulation.
        </p>

        <h2>Which is healthier?</h2>
        <p>
          Air fryers often require less oil, making them a popular choice for
          healthier cooking. However, both methods can be healthy depending on
          the recipe.
